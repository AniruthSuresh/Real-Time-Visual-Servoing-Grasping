# Real-Time-Visual-Servoing-Grasping
This project implements a Real-Time Visual Servoing framework that uses optical flow, DCEM sampling, and MPC to guide a robotic arm from an initial position to a target position for grasping tasks

### Steps

1. Create the conda environment (rtvs in this case) using the provided `environment.yml` file and activate it:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
